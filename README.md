# Heap Data Structure

This repository contains a Java implementation of a heap data structure. 
A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that adheres to the heap property.
In this implementation, we focus on a binary heap,
which allows for efficient operations like insertion, deletion
and retrieval of the maximum (for a max heap) or minimum (for a min heap) element.

## Implementation

The repository provides the following key operations:

- Insertion
- Removal
